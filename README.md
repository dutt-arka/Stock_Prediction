Stock Price Prediction using LSTM


==========================================

## LSTM Recurrent Neural Network

Long-Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network belongs to the family of deep learning algorithms. It is a recurrent network because of the feedback connections in its architecture. It has an advantage over traditional neural networks due to its capability to process the entire sequence of data. Its architecture comprises the cell, input gate, output gate and forget gate. 

## Stock Prediction

In this task, the future stock prices are predicted using the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network. Our task is to predict stock prices for a few days, which is a time series problem. The LSTM model is very popular in time-series forecasting, and this is the reason why this model is chosen in this task.
